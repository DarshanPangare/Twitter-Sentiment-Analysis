# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
Here, I have written a python script to extract data from multiple csv files. I have also, created a basic visualization of the twitter data. The data indicates various sentiments of twitter users recognised through words in their tweets. 
The main intention of this project is to showcase my Python programming, MS-Excel and Data Analysis skills.
